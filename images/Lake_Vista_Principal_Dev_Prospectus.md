# LAKE VISTA ESTATES
## Principal Development Prospectus
### A Path from Vesting Tentative to Blue-Chip Recorded Final Map

---

## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

**Project:** Lake Vista Estates – 15 Estate Lots, Granite Bay, CA  
**Location:** Granite Bay, unincorporated Placer County  
**Legal:** APNs 035-300-095-000 and 035-410-011-000 (Area 3, Record of Survey No. 2469)  
**Current Owner:** Vista Lakes Estates LLC  
**Acquisition Value:** $3.2M  
**Strategy:** Convert vesting tentative map to recorded final map, build backbone infrastructure, and position for 15 finished luxury estate lots valued at $600k–$800k each, supporting 3,500–5,000 sf homes at $2.5M–$3.5M price points.

---

## I. THE OPPORTUNITY: WHY NOW

### A. The Vesting Advantage
- **Protected Rules:** Your vesting tentative map (PLN14-00221) locks in approvals from 10+ years ago when entitlement standards were clearer and less restrictive. Current Placer County rules are stricter; your map grandfathers you.
- **Proven Timeline:** Extension letter confirms map is viable through July 2028—sufficient runway to finish final map and infrastructure.
- **Scarcity:** Multi-lot, lake-view estate subdivisions this close to completion do not come to market in Granite Bay. Most luxury projects are either fully built (Los Lagos, Shelborne) or too early-stage.

### B. Market Tailwinds
- **Luxury Demand:** Granite Bay continues to attract $2.5M+ buyers seeking lake views, equestrian access, and gated privacy.
- **Estate Lots Rare:** No new 2+ acre estate-lot subdivisions are close to offering finished lots. Current buyers must buy resales or undeveloped acreage.
- **Blue-Chip Positioning:** Proximity to Los Lagos and Walden Woods, lake views, and low density make this a natural "next-tier" enclave.

### C. Why Owners Are Selling Now
After 10 years of entitlement, carrying costs (taxes, engineering fees, holding loans) have mounted. The vesting map is their asset; selling now to a capable operator locks in value without taking construction or absorption risk.

## II. THE ASSET: WHAT YOU OWN

### A. Land Base
- **Primary Parcel:** 34.28 acres (Lot D, Los Lagos Lots D & E; Area 3, ROS 2469)
- **Secondary Parcel:** 0.91 acres (Walden Woods adjacent)
- **Total:** ~35.19 acres of developable/dedicated land
- **Title Status:** Held in LLC; clear title except for standard easements from prior Los Lagos subdivisions (Q-78).

### B. Legal Framework
- **Record of Survey No. 2469** (recorded January 2004): Boundary line adjustment showing Area 3 (your primary parcel) as a distinct, legally described entity with clear relationship to Los Lagos Lots D & E and existing easements.
- **Tract Map Q-78** (recorded January 1991): Original Los Lagos subdivision; key reference for utility easements (PCWA), pedestrian/equestrian trails, and Area J (emergency access/utilities dedication).
- **Easement Network:** Pedestrian/equestrian trails, utility corridors, and emergency access rights already in place from prior approvals—significantly reduces future conflicts.

### C. Zoning and Land Use
- **Land Use:** Vacant, designated for residential estate development.
- **Flood Zone:** Zone X (outside special flood hazard area) per FEMA mapping.
- **Fire Zone:** Standard Granite Bay wildland-urban interface; FAIR Plan baseline for homeowners insurance; mitigation strategies (tank, hardened design, defensible space) reduce risk.

---

## III. ENTITLEMENT STATUS: THE PATH TO FINAL MAP

### A. Current Approvals
- **Vesting Tentative Map (VTM):** PLN14-00221, approved with conditions under older (more favorable) Placer County standards.
- **Environmental Review:** Mitigated Negative Declaration or equivalent completed; no pending CEQA issues.
- **Extension of Time:** Map extended to July 2028; provides 2.5+ years to complete final map and infrastructure.

### B. What Remains (To Be Confirmed)
1. **Conditions of Approval (COAs):** Full PDF from Placer County Planning lists remaining requirements—typical items include:
   - Sewer connection fees and EDU (Equivalent Dwelling Unit) charges for SMD 2.
   - Road width and design standards (likely met or easily modified).
   - Tree mitigation and environmental management.
   - Fire access and water-supply specifications.
   - Off-site improvement obligations (Boulder Road, utility tie-ins).

2. **Substantial Conformance Review:** If any design change is needed (e.g., Barcelona Court connection vs. emergency-only gate + tank), a brief Substantial Conformance request protects your schedule and budget.

3. **Final Map Processing:** Once improvement plans are approved, Final Map recordation typically requires:
   - County Surveyor sign-off (technical certification).
   - Bonding or completion guarantees for public improvements.
   - Tax clearance (any delinquent balances must be paid).
   - HOA/CC&R recordation (if new association is formed).

### C. De-Risking Focus
The three items with highest leverage over your timeline and budget are:
- **Tax Delinquency:** Clear any 2023 arrears before map recordation (currently minor; confirm exact amount with County Assessor).
- **Sewer Fees:** Confirm whether SMD 2 EDU charges are pre-paid or a pass-through obligation ($30k–$60k possible per lot).
- **Barcelona/Emergency Access:** Clarify whether current COAs mandate full public through-road or emergency-only access; if the latter, a 20k-gallon tank may be sufficient fire-protection alternative.

---

## IV. ENGINEERING & INFRASTRUCTURE

### A. Current Work
- **Prior Engineering:** MacKay Sposito (or similar) prepared 30%–60% level grading, drainage, and utility plans over the past 10 years.
- **Status:** Plans exist but require updating for current code (fire standards, EV charging, stormwater) and final design refinement.

### B. Infrastructure Budget (Preliminary ROM)
| Item | On-Site (Controllable) | Off-Site (Tied to COAs) | Per-Lot Cost |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Road, grading, drainage | $60k–$80k | $20k–$40k | $80k–$120k |
| Utilities (sewer, water, power) | $30k–$50k | $20k–$30k | $50k–$80k |
| Water tank, fire apparatus | $15k–$20k | — | $15k–$20k |
| Contingency (15%) | | | $20k–$30k |
| **Total per lot** | | | **$150k–$250k** |

**Total Project Hard Cost:** ~$2.25M–$3.75M for 15 lots (excluding land acquisition and soft costs).

### C. Soft Costs & Timeline
- **Entitlement + Engineering:** 6–12 months; includes final plan revisions, substantial conformance (if needed), and county approvals.
- **Infrastructure Build:** 6–9 months after map recordation.
- **Total Duration:** 12–21 months from purchase to finished lots ready for home builders.

---

## V. LEGAL & GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

### A. Title & Easements
- **Primary Concerns:** Existing easements on Q-78 (drainage, trails, PCWA, emergency access) are pre-existing and already reflected in your ROS 2469 survey.
- **Advantage:** No title surprises; easement network is legally settled and can be incorporated into your Final Map.
- **Area J Utilization:** Emergency access and utility easement in Area J on Q-78 can support your gate/tank infrastructure, reducing need for new easement negotiations.

### B. HOA & CC&R Strategy
- **New Association:** Form "Lake Vista Estates HOA" as a separate entity (not annexed to Los Lagos or Walden Woods) to maximize flexibility.
- **CC&R Highlights:**
  - Minimum home size: 3,500 sf (competitive with Los Lagos but more flexible).
  - Architectural controls: Stone, slate, high-end finishes; consistent with neighborhood brand.
  - Fire-safe requirements: Defensible space, hardened landscaping, EV charging ready.
  - HOA Dues: Target $300–$500/month (lower than Los Lagos to attract buyers).
- **Branding:** Position as "Lake Vista Legacy Estate Enclave"—non-corporate feel, lake views, equestrian access, privacy.

### C. Title Policy
- Obtain preliminary title report on both APNs to surface any hidden liens or easements.
- Ensure title company will insure 15 individual lots post-final-map recordation.

## VI. MARKET & VALUATION

### A. Comparable Sales Analysis
**Luxury Estate Lots (Granite Bay Area, Recent Comps):**
- Los Lagos estate lots (2+ acres): $700k–$950k per lot.
- Walden Woods: $650k–$800k per lot.
- **Lake Vista Position:** $600k–$800k per lot (competitive edge: lake views, lower HOA dues, new construction quality).

**Finished Homes (Granite Bay, $2.5M–$3.5M Range):**
- Typical sales: 3,500–5,000 sf modern ranch or "Napa Valley" style.
- Price per sf: $600–$750/sf at $3M price point.
- Absorption: ~4–6 homes/year in Granite Bay at this price level (per Jennifer, local agent).

### B. Project Valuation (Preliminary)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 15 Finished Lots @ $700k avg | $10.5M |
| Less: Land cost | ($3.2M) |
| Less: Hard costs | ($2.5M–$3.0M) |
| Less: Soft costs | ($0.5M–$0.8M) |
| **Gross Profit (pre-financing)** | **$1.3M–$2.8M** |
| **Profit Margin** | **12%–27%** |

**Sensitivity:**
- If lots sell at $600k (down 15%): Profit narrows to $0.7M–$1.8M (7%–17%).
- If hard costs overrun 20%: Profit reduces by $0.5M–$0.6M.

## VII. CAPITAL STRUCTURE & YOUR ROLE

### A. Total Capital Requirement
| Use | Amount | Timing |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Land purchase (deposit → close) | $3.2M | Months 0–9 |
| Entitlement + soft costs | $0.5M–$0.8M | Months 0–12 |
| Hard costs (bonds or payment) | $2.5M–$3.0M | Months 6–18 |
| Carry (interest, taxes, contingency) | $0.3M–$0.5M | Months 0–21 |
| **Total Equity + Debt Required** | **$6.5M–$7.5M** | |

### B. Financing Strategy
- **Equity:** $4.0M–$5.0M (you raise; investor-backed).
- **Improvement Loan:** $2.0M–$2.5M (non-recourse, secured by land and future lot revenue).
- **Structure:** Waterfall to investor (preferred return 8%–10%), then promote split (80/20 or 75/25 to investor/you).

### C. Your Compensation
- **Development Fee:** 3–5% of total project cost ($0.25M–$0.35M) paid in phases:
  - 30% upon final map recordation.
  - 70% upon infrastructure completion.
- **Promote:** 20%–25% of profit above investor's hurdle rate and return of capital.
- **Role:** Project manager, entitlement coordinator, lot pre-sales liaison, and brand/positioning lead.

---

## VIII. RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### A. Entitlement Risk (Low)
- **Risk:** Change in county code or political opposition to luxury development.
- **Mitigation:** Vesting map locks in 10-year-old standards; COAs are established; limited time for material change.

### B. Fire & Insurance Risk (Medium)
- **Risk:** FAIR Plan-only coverage limits buyer pool; high premiums reduce buyer purchasing power.
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Install 20k-gallon private fire tank + monitored emergency gate.
  - Enforce hardened construction and defensible-space CC&Rs.
  - Engage insurance broker early to position for DIC (Difference in Conditions) coverage.
  - Educate buyers on total cost of ownership including insurance.

### C. Market Absorption Risk (Medium)
- **Risk:** 15 homes over 3–4 years; if luxury market slows, inventory backs up.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Pre-market lots to known builders (custom home builders in Placer/El Dorado).
  - Offer finished lots + architectural guidelines to attract JV home sales.
  - Allow flexibility in lot size/configuration if needed to fit builder specs.

### D. Cost Overrun Risk (Medium)
- **Risk:** Infrastructure or soft costs exceed ROM by 20%+ due to geotechnical, utility, or fire-code changes.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build 15% contingency into hard costs.
  - Obtain fixed-price engineering and civil design quotes.
  - Phase infrastructure so you are not locked into full upfront cost.

### E. Financing Risk (Medium)
- **Risk:** Improvement loan lender pulls out; equity investor loses confidence mid-project.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Lock improvement financing at LOI stage before final map recordation.
  - Investor agreement includes clawback protection for you if underperformance is material.
  - Maintain 6–9 month cash reserve.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Lake Vista Estates represents a rare opportunity: a legally entitled, lake-view luxury estate subdivision at a critical inflection point. The vesting tentative map protects your timeline and rules; the adjacent Los Lagos and Walden Woods provide a clear market comp; and the scarcity of similar projects in Placer County positions this as a blue-chip infill play.

Your role as Principal Developer is to finish the legal and engineering work (12–18 months), prove market demand with the first 3–5 finished lots (6–9 months), and position for an exit (sale of remaining lots to builders or investor roll-up of the LLC) within 24–36 months.

The upside is clear; the risks are manageable and mitigatable; and the team required to execute is accessible and proven.

**You are not betting on a market cycle or a builder's whim. You are executing a defined development plan on an already-approved project.**
