## PART I: DATA INVENTORY – WHAT WE HAVE

### A. Legal & Title Data (STRONG)

#### Record of Survey No. 2469 (January 2004)
- **What it shows:**
  - Boundary line adjustment for Area 3 (primary 34.28-acre parcel) as distinct from Los Lagos Lots D & E (earlier subdivision).
  - Clear survey monuments and legal description: portion of Section 25, T. 11 N., R. 7 E., M.D.B.M.
  - Confirms easements from Q-78 (drainage, trails, PCWA, Area J emergency access).
  - Shows relationship to Walden Woods, Boulder Road, and Los Lagos Equestrian Center.

#### Tract Map Q-78 (January 1991, Los Lagos Lots D & E)
- **What it shows:**
  - Original Los Lagos subdivision structure and public dedications.
  - Utility easements (PCWA, PUE - Public Utility Easement).
  - Pedestrian/equestrian trails (CL 30 trail easements).
  - Area J designation: emergency access, public/private utilities, equestrian facility access.
  - Boulder Road dedication and connection points.
  - **Critical:** These easements already benefit your property and reduce future negotiation burden.

#### APN 035-300-095-000 & 035-410-011-000 (Property Records)
- **Ownership:** Vista Lakes Estates LLC (current as of 5/23/2022 deed recording).
- **Prior Owners:** Multiple individual and trust entities (Johnson, Scotto, Moffatt, Ortiz, Steiner, Weber families).
- **Last Sale (2022):** $2.25M (grant deed Doc 2022-0043704).
- **Prior Sale (2013):** $1.305M (trustee deed).
- **Assessed Value (2025):** $2,387,718 (APN 035-410-011-000); $8.00 (APN 035-300-095-000 - likely error or split allocation).
- **Tax Bill (2024):** $24,724.92 (appears current for combined parcels).
- **Delinquency:** 2023 arrears noted; amount TBD but likely minor given current tax bill.

#### Title Status Summary
- Clear title in LLC; standard easements from prior subdivisions already documented.
- No liens, encumbrances, or unusual restrictions visible in deed chain.
- **Action Required:** Obtain preliminary title report to confirm no hidden liens or easements.

---

### B. Entitlement & Approvals Data (PARTIAL)

#### Vesting Tentative Map (PLN14-00221)
- **Status:** Approved under Placer County standards from ~2014 era (vesting rules frozen at approval date).
- **Lot Count:** 15 estate lots (confirmed on tentative map layout).
- **Extension:** Extended to July 2028; confirms map is still active and protected.
- **What This Means:**
  - Rules cannot retroactively change; your design must conform to 2014 standards, not current stricter codes.
  - You have 2.5+ years to finish final map processing and infrastructure.

#### Conditions of Approval (COAs) – INCOMPLETE
- **Status:** NOT YET OBTAINED in full form.
- **Critical Items Likely Included (based on typical Granite Bay approvals):**
  - Sewer connection (SMD 2 basin): fees and EDU charges (typically $30k-$60k per lot).
  - Road standards (width, sight distance, turning radii).
  - Fire access and water supply (secondary access, hydrants, potential tank requirement).
  - Environmental mitigation (tree preservation, grading, drainage).
  - Public/private easements (Boulder Road, trails, utility corridors).
  - Off-site improvements (Barcelona Court tie-in or emergency-only gate alternative).

#### Environmental Review
- **Status:** Assumed completed (Mitigated Negative Declaration or equivalent cited in your notes).
- **What This Means:** CEQA clearance is likely already in place; no new environmental review required for final map if design is substantially conforming.

#### Missing COA Data Impact
- **Unknown:** Exact sewer fees, specific fire marshal requirements, Barcelona requirement vs. optional gate scenario.
- **Risk Level:** Medium – if sewer fees are $60k/lot (vs. $30k), project economics shift materially.
- **Action:** Pull full COA PDF from Placer County Planning within 48 hours.

---

### C. Engineering & Infrastructure Data (MODERATE)

#### Current Plans (MacKay Sposito or equivalent)
- **Grading, Drainage, Utility Plans:** Exist at 30%-60% level; were prepared over past 10 years.
- **Status:** Need updating for current fire code (Opticom gates, hydrant specs), EV charging standards, stormwater retention.
- **What's Missing:** Final improvement plans, current cost estimates, bonding amounts.

#### Infrastructure Budget (Your ROM Assumptions – NOT VERIFIED)

| Category | Your Estimate | Confidence | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Road, grading, drainage | $80k-$120k/lot | Low | Needs Jerry's current quote. |
| Utilities | $50k-$80k/lot | Low | Sewer fees unknown; water/power straightforward. |
| Fire apparatus & tank | $15k-$20k/lot | Low | Depends on COA fire requirements. |
| Contingency (15%) | $20k-$30k/lot | Low | Applies to overruns; not yet baselined. |
| **Total per lot** | **$150k-$250k** | **Low** | **Need Jerry to confirm/adjust.** |
| **Total project** | **$2.25M-$3.75M** | **Low** | **Excludes land, soft costs, financing.** |

#### Barcelona Court Access Question
- **Current Status:** Unknown whether COAs mandate full public through-road or allow emergency-only gate.
- **Your Concept:** Swap full Barcelona connection for gated emergency-only access + 20k-gallon water tank.
- **Risk:** If COAs mandate Barcelona, gate-only may require Substantial Conformance review (adds 2-4 months, may be denied).
- **Action:** Confirm Barcelona requirement with Placer County Planning and South Placer Fire District.

---

### D. Market & Valuation Data (PARTIAL)

#### Luxury Estate Lot Comps (Your Assumptions – NOT VERIFIED)
- **Los Lagos (2+ acres):** $700k-$950k per lot.
- **Walden Woods:** $650k-$800k per lot.
- **Lake Vista Target:** $600k-$800k per lot (discount positioning vs. Los Lagos).
- **Confidence Level:** Low – based on agent feedback; need 3-5 recent actual sales comps.

#### Finished Home Comps (Granite Bay $2.5M-$3.5M)
- **Typical Product:** 3,500-5,000 sf modern ranch or "Napa Valley" style.
- **Price per sf:** $600-$750/sf at $3M price point.
- **Absorption:** ~4-6 homes/year in Granite Bay at this level (per Jennifer).
- **Confidence Level:** Medium – based on agent knowledge; need 6-12 months recent MLS data.

#### Project Valuation (Your Preliminary Model)

| Line Item | Calculation | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 15 Finished Lots @ $700k | 15 × $700k | $10.5M | Base case; sensitivity $600k-$800k |
| Land cost | (given) | ($3.2M) | Purchase price to Vista Lakes LLC |
| Hard costs | 15 × $200k (midpoint) | ($3.0M) | ROM; needs engineer verification |
| Soft costs | (eng, legal, design, permits) | ($0.65M) | Assumed 3-5% of development cost |
| **Gross Profit** | | **$3.65M** | **Pre-financing, pre-carry costs** |
| Less: Financing carry (18 months @ 7%) | | ($0.35M) | Estimate; depends on capital structure |
| Less: Contingency overrun (10% of hard) | | ($0.30M) | Buffer for unknowns |
| **Net Profit** | | **$3.0M** | **Gross margin ~28%** |

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- If lots sell $600k (−14%): Profit = $1.05M (10% margin).
- If hard costs overrun 20%: Profit = $1.8M (17% margin).
- If market absorbs slowly (year 4 close): Carry costs increase $0.2M-$0.3M.

**Confidence Level:** Low to Medium – depends on Jerry's cost confirmation and Jennifer's recent comps.

---

### E. Fire & Insurance Data (WEAK)

#### Current Situation (Granite Bay, High Fire Zone)
- **Baseline:** Most buyers use California FAIR Plan + DIC (Difference in Conditions) private carrier.
- **FAIR Plan Premium (est.):** ~$8k-$15k/year for $3M home.
- **DIC Premium (est.):** ~$2k-$5k/year add-on if eligible.
- **Your Mitigation Strategy:** 20k-gallon private fire tank + Opticom emergency gate + CC&R defensible-space requirements.

#### Missing Data

## PART III: PATHWAY TO FULL ENTITLEMENT & BLUE-CHIP COMMUNITY

### Phase 1: De-Risking the Entitlements (Months 1-3)

**Objective:** Confirm COAs, Barcelona scenario, and key cost drivers so you can structure the land acquisition confidently.

#### 1.1 – Conditions of Approval Deep Dive
- **Action:** Obtain full PLN14-00221 staff report, conditions, and any amendments from Placer County Planning Division.
- **Deliverable:** One-page matrix listing each COA, status (done/pending), cost, and responsible party.
- **Typical COAs You'll See:**
  - "Applicant shall pay all applicable sewer connection fees prior to map recordation" → Confirm $$ with SMD 2.
  - "Secondary emergency access shall be provided via Barcelona Court or equivalent" → Determine if Barcelona is mandatory or gate is alternative.
  - "Applicant shall provide fire hydrants and water supply per South Placer Fire District standards" → Confirm tank size/specs.
  - "Off-site road improvements on Boulder Road shall be bonded or built per Public Works design" → Get cost from County or consultant.

#### 1.2 – Barcelona Access Decision (Critical Fork)
- **Path A (Barcelona Mandatory):** If COAs require full public through-road, proceed with Barcelona tie-in. Cost: $300k-$500k (road construction, utility tie-in, dedication).
  - **Timeline:** 6 months design + 6 months construction; add 6 months to overall schedule.
  - **Impact:** Increases hard costs by ~$30k/lot; reduces profit by ~$0.5M.
  
- **Path B (Gate-Only Allowed / Substantial Conformance Path):** If COAs allow emergency-only access, pursue Substantial Conformance for gate + tank alternative. Cost: $150k-$250k (gate, tank, utility drops).
  - **Timeline:** 2-3 months Substantial Conformance review + 6 months construction.
  - **Impact:** Saves $300k-$250k vs. Barcelona; increases lot value perception (more private, gated).
  - **Strategy:** Position gate + tank as fire-safe equivalent to Barcelona through engineering and Fire Marshal letter.

#### 1.3 – Sewer & Utility Confirmation
- **Action:** Contact Sarah Gillmore (SMD 2) or water district representative; confirm:
  - EDU charges per lot (assume $30k-$60k; know actual number).
  - Will-serve letter confirming capacity and on-site connection points.
  - Timing (must be done before or as part of final map application).
- **Impact:** Locks in one of biggest cost unknowns.

#### 1.4 – Insurance & Fire Strategy
- **Action:** Contact South Placer Fire District and insurance broker (HUB or local):
  - Fire Marshal: Confirm tank size, gate specs, hydrant requirements, secondary access necessity.
  - Insurance broker: Feasibility of DIC coverage; premium ranges for $3M homes with/without tank mitigation.
- **Deliverable:** Conceptual sketch from Fire Marshal showing tank location, gate design approval, and hydrant layout.
- **Impact:** Validates your infrastructure strategy; provides buyer education talking points.

#### 1.5 – Tax Clearance
- **Action:** Contact Placer County Assessor; confirm 2023 delinquency amount (estimate ~$2k-$5k).
- **Impact:** Minimal; factored into land acquisition closing costs.

**Phase 1 Completion (Week 4):** You will have confirmed COAs matrix, Barcelona decision (A or B), sewer fees, fire specs, and insurance feasibility. This becomes your "entitlement foundation" for investor pitch.

---

### Phase 4: Market Positioning & Lot Sales (Months 12-36)

**Objective:** Position Lake Vista Estates as a blue-chip luxury estate enclave and begin selling finished lots to custom builders and/or executing builder JVs.

#### 4.1 – Brand & Positioning
- **Brand Identity:** "Lake Vista Legacy Estates"—lake views, equestrian access, new-build luxury, lower HOA than Los Lagos, gated privacy.
- **Marketing Materials:**
  - Lot map showing 15 parcels with view corridors and site plans.
  - Fact sheet comparing Lake Vista to Los Lagos and Walden Woods (size, HOA dues, architectural style).
  - Insurance/fire mitigation fact sheet (tank, hardened construction, fire-safe landscaping).
  - 3-5 page prospectus.

#### 4.2 – Builder Outreach (Months 12-18, in parallel with Phase 3)
- **Target Audience:**
  - Regional custom home builders active in Granite Bay / Placer County.
  - Local architects known for high-end residential.
  - Luxury real estate agents with $2.5M+ client bases.
- **Pitch:**
  - "15 estate lots, shovel-ready (infrastructure complete), architectural CC&Rs ensure cohesive high-end product."
  - "Lake views, low-density, gated entry, and proven luxury market demand."
  - "We can close on 3-5 lots in Year 1 to prove absorption; remaining lots available for additional builders or JVs."
- **Expected Outcome:** LOIs for 2-3 builders by Month 18.

#### 4.3 – Pre-Marketing & Lot Sales
- **Strategy 1 (Lot Sales):** Sell finished lots to multiple custom builders at $600k-$800k per lot.
- **Strategy 2 (Builder JV):** Partner with 1-2 builders on pre-designed portfolio of 8-12 homes.
- **Hybrid (Recommended):** Sell 3-5 lots in Year 1 to prove market + JV 8-10 with a builder; take final 2-3 as speculative.

#### 4.4 – Market Feedback & Adjustments
- **Absorption:** If 3-5 lots close in first 12-18 months at $650k-$800k, project is "de-risked"; remaining 10-12 lots marketed at confident pricing.
- **If Slow:** Adjust lot sizes, allow JV homes, reduce price, or widen architectural guidelines.
- **Timeline:** After first close, remaining lots typically sell within 12-24 months.

**Phase 4 Completion (Month 36):** 10-15 lots sold or under contract; first 1-3 homes completed; Lake Vista brand established as luxury enclave.

---

### Phase 5: Exit & Investor Liquidity (Months 24-48)

**Objective:** Return investor capital + preferred return and harvest your promote.

#### 5.1 – Exit Strategies

| Strategy | Timeline | Outcome | Your Role |
|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Lot Sales** | Months 12-24 | Close all 15 lots at $650k-$800k; liquidate and distribute proceeds. | Market + close; harvest promote. |
| **Builder JV + Remainder Sale** | Months 18-36 | 8-10 homes under JV; sell remaining 5-7 lots to new builder or roll-up entity. | Negotiate JV terms; facilitate lot sale. |
| **LLC Sell-Off** | Months 24-36 | Sell entire LLC (or remaining lots + unsold inventory) to regional builder or developer firm. | Negotiate price; transition management. |
| **Refinance & Hold** | Months 36+ | Refinance out of improvement loan; hold LLC for long-term appreciation or passive income. | Manage ongoing HOA/operations. |

#### 5.2 – Return Waterfall (Example)
Assuming $3.0M gross profit and $4.0M equity:
- Investor gets 8% preferred return (Year 1-3): ~$0.96M
- Investor gets 100% of profit until capital + pref return recovered: ~$2.04M
- Remaining profit split 80/20 (investor/you): $0.0M (in this scenario, all profit used to hit pref + return).
- **Your promote (20% above hurdle):** Activated if project over-performs; estimated $0.4M-$1.0M upside.

#### 5.3 – Timeline Waterfall
- Month 24: First lot sales close; investor gets quarterly distributions.
- Month 30: Additional lot sales; distributions continue; your promote begins accruing.
- Month 36: Majority lots sold/under contract; investor gets return-of-capital payment.
- Month 42: Final lots closing; promote realized and distributed.
- Month 48: Project wound down; investor and you both fully liquified.

**Phase 5 Completion (Month 48):** Investor has received capital + return + bonus; you have earned management fees + promote; Lake Vista Estates established as blue-chip community with 12-15 luxury homes sold/under construction.

---

## PART IV: WHAT "BLUE-CHIP" MEANS IN EXECUTION

To ensure Lake Vista Estates becomes a true **blue-chip community**, focus on these execution principles:

### 1. Architectural Cohesion
- **Strict CC&Rs:** Mandate quality standards (stone/slate finishes, minimum 3,500 sf, zero vinyl siding).
- **Architectural Review:** Pre-approval of all house designs by architect (not just county).
- **Model Home:** Build 1-2 spec homes to establish design brand (modern ranch, Napa Valley, etc.).

### 2. Amenities & Common Areas
- **Entry Monument:** High-end stone/metal gate + signage.
- **Trails & Open Space:** Well-maintained pedestrian/equestrian trails (required by easements anyway).
- **Landscape Buffer:** Mature trees, native plantings, fire-safe defensible space.
- **Private Drive:** Establish strong visual hierarchy from Boulder Road entry.

### 3. Fire & Safety Excellence
- **Proactive Fire Marshal Coordination:** Not just minimum code; exceed standards for premium insurance positioning.
- **Defensible Space Model:** Showcase to buyers; quantify insurance savings.
- **Buyer Education:** Provide fire risk disclosure + mitigation summary at sale.

### 4. Market Positioning
- **Price Point Authority:** Position as "Los Lagos alternative, not Los Lagos competitor"—lower HOA, newer construction, comparable views.
- **Lot Count Control:** With only 15 lots, maintain scarcity and exclusivity positioning.
- **Builder Mix:** Limit to 2-3 high-quality custom builders; avoid commodity product.

### 5. Ongoing Management
- **HOA Governance:** Professional HOA management company (not self-managed).
- **Maintenance Standards:** Strict enforcement of CC&Rs; regular architectural reviews.
- **Community Identity:** Annual events, consistent signage, professional landscaping maintenance.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

You have a **strong foundation** (~70% of needed data). The next 90 days are about **confirming the remaining 30%** through direct outreach to county, engineer, fire district, and market professionals. Once those confirmations come back, you will have a **bulletproof offer and investor package** to approach Vista Lakes Estates LLC.

**Your Immediate Edge:**
1. You understand the vesting map advantage (rules locked; time extended to 2028).
2. You have identified Barcelona as a decision point (saves $300k+ if gate-only allowed).
3. You positioned yourself as a **solver**, not a buyer (emphasizes blue-chip vision, not speculation).
4. You have a clear 48-month pathway to liquidity for investors and yourself.

**Your Next Move (This Week):**
- Get the COAs PDF from Placer County.
- Call Jerry for ROM.
- Contact fire district about Barcelona/gate.
- Email the prospectus to the listing broker with your cover letter.

**You are 90 days away from a Letter of Intent with Vista Lakes Estates LLC.**
